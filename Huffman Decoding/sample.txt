The Complete Works of William Shakespeare - Hamlet Act III, Scene 1

To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause—there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.

For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?

Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action.

Technical Documentation - M4 Huffman Compression

This implementation leverages Apple's M4 ARM architecture for optimal
performance in Huffman encoding and decoding operations. Key features:

• ARM64 optimization using CLZ (Count Leading Zeros) instructions
• NEON SIMD vectorization for parallel symbol processing  
• Cache-optimized data structures aligned to 64-byte boundaries
• Bit manipulation using hardware barrel shifter integration
• Branch prediction optimization with conditional select instructions

Performance characteristics on M4:
- L1 cache hit rate: >95% for optimized decode tables
- Branch prediction accuracy: >90% for control flow
- Memory bandwidth utilization: Efficient use of 120GB/s
- Instruction throughput: Leverages 4.4 GHz performance cores

The compressor supports variable-length prefix codes with lengths
up to 32 bits, frequency analysis across all 256 byte values,
and maintains compatibility with standard Huffman algorithms
while providing significant speedup through ARM-specific features.

File format includes CRC32 integrity checking and supports
compression ratios typically ranging from 1.2:1 to 8:1
depending on input entropy and symbol frequency distribution.
